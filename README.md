# SketchUp Shapes Extension


SketchUp Shapes allows users to quickly creates 3D shape objects by specifying a few attributes.  The objects created by the shapes extension are parametric so they can be edited after creation.  This extension is an Open Source project and can be improved by anyone.


## Installing

The latest and greatest is available as an RBZ file from Extension Warehouse. 

Generally, the best way to install an extension is to open Extension Warehouse from inside SketchUp, searching for  "shapes" and then click the Install button (You need to be signed in to download).  Installing via SketchUp will automatically download, unpack and place the files in the appropriate locations.  

If you need to download from outside SketchUp, follow this url - http://extensions.sketchup.com/content/shapes.

Then open SketchUp and select `Window → Preferences` (Microsoft Windows) or `SketchUp → Preferences` (Mac OS X) `→ Extensions → Install Extension` and select the RBZ file you just downloaded. Voila! SketchUp installs the extension. 

For development installations you will need to copy the contents of the `src` folder from this project, into your sketchUp plugins folder.
